Question: Consider an epidermal cell exiting from the quiescent phase (Go) of the cell cycle. Which one of the following events results in three of the four remaining events?
Options:
A. Activation of cyclin D-cdk 4/6 complex
B. Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the EGF receptor

[SBAQ]
Question: The absorption of a buffer solution containing a pure protein is measured in a spectrophotometer using a 1 cm cuvette. The value is 19.5 units. Calculate the concentration of the protein in the buffer, given that the molar absorption coefficient of the protein is 136,390 M-1 cm-1.
Options:
A. 2.7 μM
B. 2.7 mM
C. 143 mM
D. 143 μM
E. 143 nM

Explanation: Using Beer-Lambert Law (A = εcl): c = A / (ε * l). c = 19.5 / (136390 * 1) = 0.0001429 M, which converts to approximately 143 μM.

[SBAQ]
Question: A 78 year old female patient attends her GP with tiredness and pins and needles in her fingers and toes. A full blood count shows the patient to be anaemic with a haemoglobin of 95 g/l (NR 115-140 g/l) with a mean cell volume of 112 fl (NR 83-98). What mechanism and cause best explains these findings?
Options:
A. Reduced red cell production due to reduced vitamin B12 absorption
B. Increased red cell destruction due to inadequate dietary folate
C. Increased red cell destruction due to increased erythropoietin production
D. Reduced red cell production due to reduced globin chain synthesis
E. Reduced red cell production due to inadequate dietary iron
Correct Answer: A. Reduced red cell production due to reduced vitamin B12 absorption
Explanation: The high MCV (112 fl) indicates macrocytic anaemia. Combined with neurological symptoms ("pins and needles"), this is classic for B12 deficiency (pernicious anaemia), which causes production failure.

Question: Patient X has a high caloric intake but low weight. Based on the mitochondrial oxygen consumption graph (respiration continues despite Oligomycin), what can you conclude about their mitochondria?
Accepted Answers: Uncoupled from ATP production
Explanation: Oligomycin blocks ATP synthase. In normal mitochondria, this stops respiration. If respiration continues, electron transport is "uncoupled" from ATP synthesis (energy is lost as heat).

Accepted Answers: Autosomal dominant
Explanation: "Gain of function" mutations (constitutive activation) usually manifest as Autosomal Dominant traits because one mutant copy is enough to drive the phenotype.

[VSAQ]
Question: The chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) plays a key role in HIV infection. What stage of the infection process is it involved in?
Accepted Answers: Cell entry, Viral binding
Explanation: CCR5 acts as a co-receptor (along with CD4) that allows the HIV virus to fuse with and enter the host T-cell.

[SAQ]
Intro: Statins such as lovastatin act by competitively binding to the catalytic domain of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, HMGCR).
Parts:
1. (2 marks) Why are statins useful medications for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and why is HMGCR an ideal target for such drugs?
   Model Answer: HMG-CoA reductase catalyses the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Reduction in HMG-CoA activity therefore results in reduced cholesterol levels.
2. (2 marks) The accompanying graphs present data sets showing that experimental treatment of mice with lovastatin results in an increase in HMGCR in liver at the protein and mRNA levels. Suggest how the liver responds to treatment with lovastatin. How do you think this might alter the usefulness of statins following prolonged treatment?
   Model Answer: The liver appears to compensate for reduced HMGCR function by increasing production of HMGCR at RNA and protein levels. The usefulness of statins in treating therefore be reduced if treatment is prolonged.
3. (3 marks) Compound 81 is a novel, small molecule discovered to enhance the rate of degradation of HMGCR. Describe the effects of compound 81 and lovastatin on the formation of atherosclerotic lesions based on the data.
   Model Answer: Compound 81 alone significantly reduces lesion area. The effectiveness of compound 81 in reducing lesion area is equivalent to lovastatin. The combination of compound 81 and lovastatin is significantly more effective than either single treatment.
4. (3 marks) The cholesterol metabolite 7-dehydrocholesterol is an intermediate in the synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolite known as calcitriol. Suggest why the increased use of sunscreen might be related to low levels of calcitriol in apparently healthy young adults.
   Model Answer: Calcitriol acts as a steroid hormone to induce key genes involved in bone metabolism. A key stage in the metabolism of 7-dehydrocholesterol to calcitriol is the action of UV light. Sunscreens block UV light and hence the production of calcitriol.

Intro: A mature T-cell responds to the chemokines CCL22 and CCL17 by leaving the circulation and entering inflamed skin where it may encounter antigen.
Parts:
1. (3 marks) Name the class of molecules denoted by the letters A and B and the cellular process denoted by the letter C.
   Model Answer: A is Selectin. B is Integrin. Process is transcytosis a.k.a. diapedesis or transmigration.

   Model Answer: A = e * c * l (Beer-Lambert Law). C = 24.5 / 136390 = 0.000180 M. C = 180 uM (units required).
4. (3 marks) Describe three mechanisms that bacteria use to evade the effects of antibodies.
   Model Answer: Capsule to hide antigens. Surface proteins (eg. Spa) that bind the Fc region and disrupt function. Secreted proteins (eg. SSL10) that bind the Fc region and prevent detection OR Express bacterial proteases that cleave immunoglobulin.
